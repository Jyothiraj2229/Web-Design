<h2>Vice-Chancellor:</h2>
<p>The Vice-Chancellor is the academic and executive head of the University. The Vice-Chancellor  provides both academic and administrative leadership.  The Vice-Chancellor is appointed by the Chancellor on the recommendation of the Government.  A search committee, consisting of nominees of the State Government, University and University Grants Commission prepares a panel of names, for the purpose.  Based on this panel, the Government makes its selection.  The Vice-Chancellor is appointed for a three year term and is eligible for reappointment for one more term.</p>
 <p>
The Vice-Chancellor is the Chairman of the Executive Council and Academic Senate.  As such the Vice-Chancellor plays a pivotal role in formulating policies and taking major decisions - both academic and administrative.  Although the Vice-Chancellor is empowered to take decisions by himself, yet the Vice-Chancellor very seldom exercises this option.  The Vice-Chancellor is the appointing authority of all the officers of the University, including the heads of Departments, Chairmen of Boards of Studies, Principals etc.  The Vice-Chancellor exercises control over the University's finances and keeps a watch on the performance of different academic and administrative wings.  The reputation and image of the University broadly depends on the dynamism, vision and leadership provided by the Vice-Chancellor.</p></tr>
